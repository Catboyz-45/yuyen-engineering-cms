# Media and object storage

The CMS stores images and PDF catalogs in a private S3-compatible bucket. The
database stores metadata and references only; uploaded bytes are never written
to the application filesystem.

## Configuration

Set `S3_ENDPOINT` for providers such as Cloudflare R2, MinIO, or DigitalOcean
Spaces. It can be omitted for AWS S3. Set `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true` when a local
MinIO installation requires path-style requests. Keep the bucket private.

Browsers load images and upload files through signed URLs, so the signed host
must be reachable from the user's machine. When the app reaches storage by an
internal name (for example `http://minio:9000` inside Docker Compose), set
`S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` to the public address. The Content-Security-Policy is built
at runtime from `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` (or `S3_ENDPOINT`), `S3_BUCKET`,
`S3_REGION`, and `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE`, so changing storage needs a restart, not
a rebuild.

The bucket CORS policy must permit `PUT` from the exact CMS origin and the
`Content-Type` header. Do not use a wildcard production origin:

```json
[{"AllowedOrigins":["https://cms.example.co.th"],"AllowedMethods":["PUT"],"AllowedHeaders":["Content-Type"],"ExposeHeaders":["ETag"],"MaxAgeSeconds":300}]
```

The runtime identity needs only GetObject, PutObject, DeleteObject, and
ListBucket for the configured bucket/prefix. Keep credentials in the hosting
secret manager.

## Upload lifecycle

The server creates a random temporary key and returns a 15-minute signed PUT.
After direct upload, the completion endpoint checks size, MIME and magic bytes,
then computes SHA-256. Images are orientation-normalized, metadata-stripped, and
emitted as WebP and AVIF at 320, 640, 1280, and up to 1920 pixels without
enlargement. Metadata and variants become READY together; temporary objects enter
a durable cleanup queue. A completed upload has a 24-hour attachment lease.
Saving it as company or content data clears that lease; an abandoned,
unreferenced upload becomes eligible for cleanup after the lease expires.

PDFs and draft-only images remain private. Published references are delivered
through `/api/media/<id>` using short-lived signed redirects. Public access also
requires the referencing record to be non-trashed and past its publication time;
Draft, Archived, future-scheduled, and trashed records do not expose their media.

## Cleanup and deletion

Run this idempotent command at least hourly from one scheduled job:

```bash
npm run media:cleanup
```

Deletion first verifies relational references, then soft-deletes metadata for 30
days. Cleanup transactionally creates a durable deletion task before removing
metadata. Object deletion retries with exponential backoff. Expired and failed
uploads use the same path. Removing a new file from the editor aborts its active
browser transfer and marks any server-side upload already created for immediate
cleanup. Monitor unfinished `StorageCleanupJob` rows.

Dashboard usage is the sum of known PDFs and image derivatives. Provider metrics
remain authoritative because they can include multipart remnants or foreign
objects.

## Malware scanning

Every uploaded image and PDF is sent to ClamAV using the in-memory `INSTREAM`
protocol after signature validation and before derivatives or final objects are
created. An infected file, timeout, unavailable scanner, or invalid scanner
response fails closed: the media remains unavailable with status `FAILED`.

Docker Compose runs the official ClamAV image and persists its signature
database. Production configuration must set `MALWARE_SCAN_MODE=required`; the
environment validator rejects `disabled` in production. Configure
`CLAMAV_HOST`, `CLAMAV_PORT`, and `CLAMAV_TIMEOUT_MS` for the private ClamAV
endpoint. Never expose port 3310 publicly because clamd has no authentication.

Local development outside Docker may use `MALWARE_SCAN_MODE=disabled`. This is
not accepted when `NODE_ENV=production`. Keep virus definitions updated and
monitor ClamAV health and failed media records before accepting uploads.
